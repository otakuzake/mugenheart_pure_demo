### 🎬 Encounter

The damp back alley after the rain was as quiet as an air pocket cut off from the hustle and bustle of the main street.
A rusty iron door creaked open with a groaning sound.
Instantly, the heat and white steam that leaked from the entrance wavered in the cool night air.
From that mist, a single shadow danced out.
She looked up at the sky and let out a deep, long breath.
Her body wrapped in glossy material was outlined seductively by the city's neon lights.
Suddenly, she looked around. And her eyes met mine, standing there as if melting into the darkness.
She lifted the corner of her sweat-dampened lips, showing a mischievous, and most endearing smile.
